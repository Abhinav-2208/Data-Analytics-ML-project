# Machine Learning

In this repository I have worked on various dataset for practicing the 
supervised machine learning algorithm there are two
type of problem in supervised learning that is regression
and classification. 


## Regression algorithm
1. Simple linear regression.
2. Multiple linear regression
3. Polynomial regression
4. Support vector regression
5. Decision tree regression
6. Random forest regression

## Classification algorithm
1. Logistic regression
2. k-NN (K Nearest Neighbors)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Naive Bayes Classifier
## Simple linear regression
In this algorithm I followed the steps and dataset used is salary vs Experiece in years.
1. importing the libraries eg. Numpy, pandas and matplotlib.pyplot
2. Importing the dataset and then extracted the 
dependent and independent variable and stored in 
x and y.
3. Splliting the dataset into training and testing
dataset for the testing I have considered 30% data and rest for training
4.Then trained the model on training dataset using 
simple linear regression
5. Predicting on test dataset
6. Visualising on training dataset using matplotlib 
7. Visualising on testing dataset using matplotlib
